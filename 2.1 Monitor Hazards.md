# Monitor and assess multiple hazards
You can monitor multiple hazards in DisasterAWARE. A hazard is displayed in the system when an occurrence or incident poses substantial threat to people, property, or assets as determined by disaster management authorities. 

We continue to add new hazard types as reliable information becomes available.
