## View multiple time zones for areas you wish to monitor

Work across multiple time zones? You can view the time of day in multiple locations in the black bar at the top of the screen by clicking **Time Zones** under the **Preferences Tab**.

Click and hold on the three lines and drag to change the clock order.

When editing time zones, you can name the time zone after a specific asset you’re monitoring (e.g. Headquarters).
NOTE: When you click a hazard icon on the map, the time zone in which the hazard is located will then be highlighted in blue—switching from the default UTC.
