## View multiple time zones for areas you wish to monitor

Work across multiple time zones? You can view the time of day in multiple locations in the black bar at the top of the screen by clicking **User > Preferences > Time Zones**.

Click and hold on the three lines next to a location and drag up or down to change the clock order.

Click the arrow (pictured above) to edit time zones displayed at top of map (pictured below). **Tip:** If you have fewer than five time zones selected, you will have the option to add time zones.

When editing time zones, you can name the time zone after a specific asset you’re monitoring (e.g. Headquarters).
NOTE: When you click a hazard icon on the map, the time zone in which the hazard is located will then be highlighted in blue—switching from the default UTC.
