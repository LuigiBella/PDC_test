## Expired/historic hazards

Each hazard eventually expires, but the data can still be accessed. Historical hazard information is useful for realistic exercise scenarios and in After
Action Reviews. Start by clicking on Expire. 

To avoid making the search too broad, but sure to select a date range, the location or name of the hazard in the "Name" field, and the type of hazard. Once you have made your selections click "Done."
