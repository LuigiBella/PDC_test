##	Zooming and scrolling the map

Start with the navigation toolbar on the right of the screen. Be sure to clear your browser zoom settings. If your browser is zoomed beyond 100%, or is less than 100%, the map will not function as designed. Press “Ctrl + 0” keys (or “Cmd + 0” on a Mac) to reset your browser zoom.

**Zooming:** To zoom in on the map, click the the “+” and “–” options or use the scroller on your mouse.
DO NOT use “Ctrl +” or “Ctrl –” key commands as these will zoom your whole browser, which always needs to be set to 100%.

While on a mobile device, pinch open or pinch close to zoom in or out.

**Pro Tip:** You can also zoom to an area of interest by double clicking on that location on the map.
