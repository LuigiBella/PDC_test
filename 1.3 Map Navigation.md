# Map Navigation Basics

You can monitor a large number of different hazards in DisasterAWARE. A hazard is displayed in the system when an occurrence or incident poses substantial threat to people, property, or assets as determined by disaster management authorities.

##	Zooming and scrolling the map

Start with the navigation toolbar on the right of the screen. Be sure to clear your browser zoom settings. If your browser is zoomed beyond 100%, or is less than 100%, the map will not function as designed. Press “Ctrl + 0” keys (or “Cmd + 0” on a Mac) to reset your browser zoom.

**Zooming:** To zoom in on the map, click the the “+” and “–” options or use the scroller on your mouse.
DO NOT use “Ctrl +” or “Ctrl –” key commands as these will zoom your whole browser, which always needs to be set to 100%.

While on a mobile device, pinch open or pinch close to zoom in or out.

**Pro Tip:** You can also zoom to an area of interest by double clicking on that location on the map.

**Home position:** Use the home button to return to your default map and zoom position.

**Undo or redo** to return to previous zoom positions.

**Zoom tools:** Click the plus or minus symbol to zoom into or out of an area. You may also use your mouse scroller to zoom in or out, or pinch with your fingers to zoom in or out on mobile devices. Avoid using the Ctrl “+” key command as this will zoom the resolution of your browser window and can hide some features.

## Panning the map
The panning tool is selected by default so you can pan the map by clicking and dragging with a mouse or by swipping with your finger. You can also use traditional zooming in/out techniques with the mouse roller or pinch and expanded with your fingers for touch screen.
